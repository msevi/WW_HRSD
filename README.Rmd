## About
The overall goal of hybrid assembly is to combine short and long reads to improve contiguity.  

Short reads:  

* Cheap  
* Accurate  
* Small contig size  
* Gaps  
    
Long reads:  

* Relative inexpensive  
* High error rate

## Data description
Bi-monthly sampling of Virginia Initiative Plant of raw influent and treated effluent.  

* Raw: 100 mL  
* Treated: 1000 mL  

Short read output:  

* Platform: Illumina NovaSeq  

Long read output:  

* Platform: MinIon R9.5 flow cell  
Note: Basecalling to be performed offline. 

## Preprocessing strategy  

Short read:  
1. Rename files and  produce a linkage file  
2. Use fastp with polyG and polyX trimming  
3. Check for vector contamination with UniVec  

Long read:  
Basecalling with guppy was performed on google cloud by Chris and commands to set it up can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/chrisLanderson/3f8443e5ab837c14c2249102343b6587){target="blank_"}

The basecaller automatically trims all the adapter sequences and it removes sequences with a mean Q < 7, plus maybe a few other things. Usually these reads are ready for most downstream processes.
